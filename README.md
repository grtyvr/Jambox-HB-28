I'm attempting to use the synthesis from the Auduino project for this.

Almost nothing is done yet. The synthesis ( ported over from the Auduino project ) is kid of working, but I'm having issues with the bitrate or something so it sounds pretty nasty.

Alot of sequencer code has been written, but none of it is finished or running yet.
I added an Oled screen to mine, although I haven't started implimenting it yet.
